# Shell Sort
## just like insertion sort
## but instead of 1 el gap, we have h el gap now
## also called n-gap sort

# pseudo code
## start with h=size/2 and after every iteration decrease h by division of 2 until it becomes 1(insertion sort)
## inner 2 loops are just like insertion sort
## there we compare h-gap separated el's and swap if needed
